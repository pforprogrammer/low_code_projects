```json
{
  "name": "line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]",
  "value": "5000"  // Amount in cents (50.00 CAD)
}
```

### Changing Reminder Schedule

In the **Schedule Trigger** node:
- Adjust `triggerAtHour` and `triggerAtMinute`

- Conversation flow management
- Context-aware responses


## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. AI Agent Not Responding
**Symptoms:** No response after sending WhatsApp message

**Solutions:**
- Check WhatsApp Trigger is activated
- Verify webhook URL in WhatsApp Business settings
- Ensure Google Gemini API key is valid
- Check n8n execution logs for errors

#### 2. Payment Link Not Generated
**Symptoms:** No payment link received after selecting Stripe payment

**Solutions:**
- Verify Stripe API key is correct
- Check "If" node condition (payment_method contains "Stripe")
- Ensure Google Sheets Trigger is monitoring new rows
- Verify appointment was saved to Appointments sheet

#### 3. Slots Not Showing Correctly
**Symptoms:** Booked slots still appear as available

**Solutions:**
- Check "Get All Appointments" tool is connected to AI Agent
- Verify date format in Appointments sheet (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Ensure time format is consistent (HH:MM)
- Review AI Agent prompt for slot exclusion logic

#### 4. Refunds Not Processing
**Symptoms:** Cancellation confirmed but no refund initiated

**Solutions:**
- Verify `stripe_payment_intent` field has value
- Check Stripe API key permissions include refunds
- Review "If2" node condition for empty check
- Check HTTP Request2 node headers and body

#### 5. Reminders Not Sending
**Symptoms:** No reminder messages sent for today's appointments

**Solutions:**
- Verify Schedule Trigger is activated
- Check timezone setting matches your location
- Ensure appointments have status "Confirmed" or "Pending"
- Review Appointment Remainder AI Agent prompt

#### 6. Memory Issues
**Symptoms:** Bot doesn't remember previous conversation

**Solutions:**
- Check Simple Memory node session key configuration
- Verify context window length (currently 6 messages)
- Test with fresh conversation after making changes

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in n8n:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environments
2. Set `EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=all`
3. Set `EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=all`
4. Review execution logs for detailed error messages
